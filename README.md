# MiniAttendanceManagementSystem-Node.js

This Node.js application was designed to take attendance of a particular class in a School.
My first project to learn the following things:-
1. Node.js
2. Express.js
3. Mongoose
4. Body Parser
5. Heroku deployment

## Other Stuff
Also implemented the rateLimit using the express-rate-limit library to ensure non-exploitation of the API.
XSS, Helmet, MongoSantize middlewares to filter data and ensure security.

## Improvements
1. Server & Client Side Validation
2. Proper Folder Structure
3. Refactor from Client-Server to Microservices
4. Provisioning resources using IaC, using servless framework
